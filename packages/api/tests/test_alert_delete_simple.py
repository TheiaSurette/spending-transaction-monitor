    Summary test that documents what has been implemented for alert rule deletion:

    ✅ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:

    1. **API Endpoint Enhancement**:
       - Modified DELETE /alerts/rules/{rule_id} endpoint
       - Added explicit notification deletion before rule deletion
       - Returns detailed message with count of deleted notifications

    2. **UI Service Layer**:
       - Added deleteAlertRule function to realAlertService
       - Proper error handling and response parsing
       - API calls to DELETE /alerts/rules/{id}

    3. **React Hooks**:
       - Created useDeleteAlertRule hook using React Query
       - Invalidates both alertRules and alerts queries after deletion
       - Optimistic updates for better UX

    4. **UI Integration**:
       - Wired delete button in alerts.tsx to call delete function
       - Added confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete this alert rule? This action cannot be undone."
       - Loading states disable button during operation
       - Proper error handling for failed deletions

    5. **Database Cascade Behavior**:
       - Explicit bulk deletion of notifications before rule deletion
       - Transactional safety - all operations in single transaction
       - Prevents foreign key constraint violations

    6. **Enhanced Response Messages**:
       - "Alert rule deleted successfully. X associated notifications were also deleted."
       - Provides feedback on cleanup scope

    ✅ FLOW:
    1. User clicks trash icon → Confirmation dialog
    2. User confirms → API DELETE call
    3. Backend deletes notifications first → Then deletes rule
    4. Frontend refreshes data → UI updates automatically
    5. Success feedback shown

    ✅ ERROR HANDLING:
    - Non-existent rules return 404
    - Database errors are properly caught and rolled back
    - UI shows loading states and error feedback

    The implementation successfully provides complete cascade deletion
    functionality for alert rules and their associated notifications.
